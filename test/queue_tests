things to test for in queue.c

method # of tests
* notes

qopen 1
* just open. make sure the queue pointer isn't null

qclose 2
* qclose on an empty queue. make sure the queue pointer is null
* qclose on a non-empty queue. just to make sure no memory leaks happen

qput 2
* tbh i have no idea how to make this testable so good luck here
* qput into an empty queue
* qput into a non-empty queue 

qget 2
* qget on an empty queue. simple, check if it returns something (here "something" will be none).
* qget on a non-empty queue. also have to make sure the pointer changed. maybe 2 gets in a row?

qapply 2
* qapply on a nonempty queue. sum up a queue of numbers that you just changed.
* qapply on an empty queue. just make sure that sum is 0

qsearch 3
* qsearch on an empty list. returns null.
* qsearch on a queue that contains object, returns that object
* qsearch on a queue that doesn't contain object, returns null

qremove 4
* empty queue
* at front of queue
* at back of queue
* at middle of queue

qconcat 3
* two empty queues
* one empty queue, one nonempty queue
* two nonempty queues

+ whatever else yall think of.
